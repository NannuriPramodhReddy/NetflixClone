BACKEND

1. Plan Your Backend


User registration and login.

Movie database (add, fetch, and search).

Session management for authentication (using cookies and sessions).

2. Set Up Your Environment
Install Node.js and npm.

Install MongoDB locally or use a cloud database (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).

3. Initialize the Project
Create a project folder and initialize it using npm init.

Organize the project with meaningful folders:

Models for database schemas.

Routes for API endpoints.

Controllers for route logic.

Config for environment variables and database setup.

4. Install Dependencies
Required packages:

Express for server setup.

Mongoose for MongoDB connection.

dotenv for environment variables.

express-session for session-based authentication.

5. Connect to MongoDB
Set up the connection to your MongoDB database.

Use meaningful collections:

Users for user information (e.g., name, email, password).

Movies for storing movie details (e.g., title, genre, release year).

6. Develop Core APIs
User Authentication:

Register users with name, email, and password.

Log in users with email and password.

Use sessions for managing user login state.

Movie Management:

Fetch all movies.

Search movies by title or genre.

FORNT-END

1. PLAN THE APPLICATION
Identify the features:

User Authentication (Login & Register)

Movie Display and Search

Responsive Navigation

Dynamic API Integration

Decide on the tools:

Frontend Framework: React

Styling: CSS (or Tailwind/Styled-Components)

API Integration: Axios for fetching movie and user data

Routing: React Router DOM


2. SET UP YOUR PROJECT
Create the React App:

Use npx create-react-app netflix-clone.

Install Dependencies:

npm install react-router-dom axios

Set Up Folder Structure:

cpp
Copy
Edit
src/
├── api.js                // Centralized API logic
├── components/           // Reusable UI components
├── pages/                // App pages (Home, Login, Register, etc.)
├── assets/               // Images, logos, etc.
├── App.js                // App's main structure
├── App.css               // Global styles
└── index.js              // React rendering entry point
3. BUILD REUSABLE COMPONENTS
Navbar: A top navigation bar with links to Home, Login, and Register.

Search Form: A search bar that filters movies dynamically.

Movie Grid: Displays movies in a grid with hover effects for details.

4. DESIGN PAGES
Home Page:

Fetch and display movies from the API.

Include a search feature to filter movies by title.

Login Page:

A form to accept email and password.

Handle login logic using API.

Register Page:

A form to collect username, email, and password.

Display success or error messages after submitting.

5. IMPLEMENT API LOGIC
Use Axios for:

Fetching movies: /movies

Searching movies: /movies/search

Registering users: /auth/register

Logging in users: /auth/login

Centralize all API calls in a single api.js file for maintainability.

6. STYLING THE APP
Dark Theme:

Background: Black (#000)

Text: White (#fff)

Accent Color: Netflix Red (#e50914)

Responsive Design:

Use CSS Grid/Flexbox for layout.

Ensure mobile, tablet, and desktop compatibility.

Modern UI:

Hover animations for movie items.

Use padding and margin for proper spacing.
